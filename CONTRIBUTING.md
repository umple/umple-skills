### Skill anatomy

Each skill has two layers:

| Layer | Purpose | When to modify |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| `SKILL.md` | Workflow orchestration | Changing when/how the skill triggers |
| `references/` | Domain knowledge + API docs | Updating Umple syntax, API details, or patterns |

Skills call the Umple Online API using whatever HTTP tool is available in the agent's environment. The `references/api-reference.md` in each skill documents the endpoint, parameters, and response parsing.

## Pull request guidelines

1. Explain the problem and your proposed solution.
2. Keep PRs focused and reasonably small.
3. Link related issues if available.
4. Include sample commands/output when behavior changes.
5. Update docs (`README.md`, `SKILL.md`, references) for user-facing changes.
6. Test API calls against the Umple Online endpoint before submitting.
7. **Do not commit zip files.** Skill zips are built automatically by CI and attached to GitHub Releases. Use `./build-zips.sh` for local testing only.

## Review expectations

A good PR is ready to merge when:

- The change is clear and scoped
- Documentation is updated
- A maintainer review is completed
