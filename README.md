# Skills

A collection of AI skills for working with Umple - a Model-Oriented Programming technology that allows you to create textual UML models, add UML constructs directly into your code (Java, Python, PHP, C++, Ruby), generate high-quality code from UML models, and visualize models as UML diagrams.

## Dependencies

- **Umple CLI**: Diagram generation engine
- **Graphviz**: SVG conversion
- **Bun**: TypeScript runtime
- **npx**: Package executor for running the skill installer

## Installation

```bash
# Install via skills command (requires NPX)
npx skills add elwinLiu/umple-skills
```

## umple-diagram-generator

This skill enables AI agents to generate UML diagrams (class diagrams, state machines, etc.) from natural-language requirements using Umple's textual modeling format.

## What This Skill Does

This skill helps AI agents convert textual requirements into visual UML diagrams by:
1. Reading diagram-specific guidance from the `references/` folder
2. Generating valid Umple code based on user requirements
3. Running Umple CLI to produce SVG diagrams

```bash
# Sync to agents directory
./sync-skills.sh
```
Use the script when you're managing local skills at ~/.agents (Recommended if you're using multiple harnesses)
